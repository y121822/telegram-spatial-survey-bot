Spatial Survey Bot

The Bot uses pre-created Surveys to collect coordinates 
of spatial objects, their text and media description. 
Collected data can be viewed as a Web Map, downloaded as a
Shapefile/GeoJSON and then can be used in any GIS software 
for further processing and analysis.

Only the creator of a Survey can view/download data,
whereas participants can only collect it. However, anyone can 
create their own Survey and share it with others.
